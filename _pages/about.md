I am currently a researcher at [the L3S Institute](https://www.l3s.de/the-l3s/), Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.

I work at the interface of **artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedicine**, with the long term goal of developing and applying AI/ML algorithms to tackle societal challenges, such as cancer and aging. 

Currently, my focus is on (1) **biological LLMs** -- especially single-cell foundation models -- for disease modeling and drug-response prediction; and (2) **AI agent systems** that can plan, reason, and act across heterogeneous, real-world biomedical data by leveraging LLM multi-step reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and real-time tool usage.

Previously I developed a machine-learning-assisted clinical framework for oncology data integration, analysis and visualization. This framework is incorporated into routine diagnostics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, assisting clinicians in patient subtyping and decision-making.

I obtained my PhD from [Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, USA](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/), where I used a system biology approach to study the PI3K/PTEN pathway and developed an excitable network model. I obtained a master's degree from  [Freie Universität Berlin, Germany](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). My master thesis is on developing deep learning models for peptide acetylation. <!--I obtained my bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology, China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).-->
